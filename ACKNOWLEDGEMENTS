The initial development of flite was primarily done by awb while
travelling, perhaps the name is doubly appropriate as a substantial
amount of the coding was done over 30,000ft).  During most of that
time awb was funded by the Language Technonologies Institute at
Carnegie Mellon University.

Kevin A. Lenzo was involved in the design, conversion techniques and
representions for the voice distributed with flite (as well as being
the actual voice itself).

Other contributions are:

David Huggins-Daines (dhd@cepstral.com) 
   much of the clunits code, porting to multiple platforms, substantial
   code tidy up and configure/autoconf guidance.
Cepstral, LLC (http://cepstral.com)
   For supporting DHD to spend time on flite and passing back the important
   fixes and enhancements including SAPI support
Willie Walker <william.walker@sun.com> and the rest of the Sun Speech Group
   lots of low level bugs (and fixes).
Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) Praxis XXI program
   The SAPI interface provided by Cepstral, LLC was partially funded by
   the above program.
Henry Spencer
   For the regex code
University of Edinburgh
   for releasing Festival for free, making a companion runtime synthesizer
   a practical project, much of the design of flite relies on the 
   architecture decisions made in the Festival Speech Synthesis Systems and
   the Edinburgh Speech Tools.
   The duration cart tree and intonation (accent and F0) models were
   derived from the models in the Festival distribution. which in turn
   were trained from the Boston University FM Radio Data Corpus.
Carnegie Mellon University
   The included lexicon is derived from CMULEX and the letter to sound
   rules are constructed using the Lenzo and Black techniques for
   building LTS decision graphs.
